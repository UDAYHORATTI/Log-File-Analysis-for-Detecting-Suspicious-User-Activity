# Log-File-Analysis-for-Detecting-Suspicious-User-Activity
Parse system log files such as syslog, authentication logs, and bash history. Detect abnormal user activity, such as multiple failed login attempts, use of privileged commands, or unauthorized access. Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, Random Forest) to classify the behavior as normal or suspicious.
